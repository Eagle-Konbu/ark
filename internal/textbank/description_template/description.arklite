# ArkLite Format Overview

Project: %s
Path: %s

This file is written in ArkLite format — a compact, LLM-optimized representation of an entire project directory.

It consists of three sections:

1. **Description** — An explanation of the project and this format.
2. **Directory Structure (JSON)** — A hierarchical representation of the directory layout as a JSON tree.
3. **File Dump (ArkLite format)** — The actual content of each file, represented compactly on one line each.

### ArkLite File Dump Format

- Each file is introduced by a line starting with `@<relative-path>`.
- The next line contains the file’s full contents compressed into a single line.
- Newlines within files are replaced with the `␤` symbol (U+2424) to preserve their position.
- All comments (`//`, `#`, `/* */`, `<!-- -->`, etc.) have been removed to reduce token cost.
- File order and relative paths implicitly preserve directory structure.

This format allows large-scale codebases to be consumed efficiently by language models.
