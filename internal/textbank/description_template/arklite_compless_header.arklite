Arklite Format Overview

Project: %s
Path: %s

This file is written in Arklite format — a compact, LLM-optimized representation of an entire project directory.

It consists of three sections:
  1. Description — An explanation of the project and this format.
  2. Directory Structure (JSON) — A hierarchical representation of the directory layout as a JSON tree.
  3. File Dump (Arklite format) — The actual content of each file, represented compactly on one line each.

Arklite File Dump Format:
  - Each file is introduced by a line starting with @<relative-path>
  - The next line contains the file’s full contents compressed into a single line.
  - Newlines within files are replaced with the ␤ symbol (U+2424) to preserve their position.
  - All comments (//, #, /* */, <!-- -->, etc.) have been removed to reduce token cost.
  - File order and relative paths implicitly preserve directory structure.

IMPORTANT:
  This file is *compressed using the Arklite format*. Before using or interpreting its contents,
  you MUST first expand (decode) this file using an appropriate Arklite-compatible tool.

  After decoding, you will obtain a single file in %s formats

  Do NOT attempt to directly read or process the compressed contents.
  Always decode first, then interpret as the extracted file type.

This format enables large-scale codebases to be efficiently consumed by language models and other automation tools.
